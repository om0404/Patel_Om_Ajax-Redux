# Star Wars Character/Movie Guide

This project is a character/movie guide for Star Wars, built using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). It allows users to explore information about Star Wars characters and their respective movies.

## Overview

Working by myself, this project involves creating a responsive character/movie guide using HTML, CSS, and AJAX. The guide fetches data from the Star Wars API, populates an unordered list with characters, and allows users to click on a character to retrieve movie information.

## Features

- Fetches data from the Star Wars API.
- Populates an unordered list with characters.
- Allows users to click on a character to fetch and display movie details (title, opening crawl, and poster image).
- Responsive design from mobile to desktop.
- Additional GreenSock enhancements.

## Installation
